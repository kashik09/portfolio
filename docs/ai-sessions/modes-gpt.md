ChatGPT said:
girl yeah — it’s clean, but it’s giving LinkedIn internship energy instead of Kashi main character 😭
Let’s loosen it up without turning it messy.

I’ll give you vibes + concrete UI ideas, with visuals so you can see it.

1️⃣ Pick a PERSONAL aesthetic lane (not “developer default”)
Right now you’re in:

minimal • professional • safe • polite

We want:

expressive • curious • playful-smart • a little chaotic

Option A: “Soft Hacker / Creative Dev” (this feels very you)

How it looks

Dark or off-white background

Pastel accents (lavender, sky blue, mint)

Rounded everything

Code elements used playfully, not seriously

UI tweaks

Avatar isn’t a circle — try:

hand-drawn outline

blob shape

slightly off-center frame

Section dividers look like comments:

// about me
2️⃣ Fix the biggest offender: the HERO SECTION
Your current hero says:

“Junior Developer from Kampala, Uganda”

That’s fine… but boring 😭

Rewrite it to sound like you
Examples

“I build things because I get annoyed when tools don’t exist.”

“I turn random ideas into small, useful software.”

“I code my way out of problems I personally have.”

Layout idea

hi, i’m kashi ✨
i build small tools,
break them,
then make them better.

[ see projects ]   [ read my story ]
Short lines. Breathing space. Confidence.

3️⃣ Your text is way too formal — let it talk
Your “My Story” reads like an application essay.

Let’s humanize it.

Instead of:
“I’m an aspiring software engineer passionate about creating innovative solutions…”

Try:
“I like figuring out how things work.
At some point, curiosity turned into code.”

Or:

“Most of my projects start with ‘this is annoying, I can build something better.’”

Visual way to present this

https://public-images.interaction-design.org/literature/articles/materials/build-a-standout-ux-ui-portfolio-04-04-01.png?utm_source=chatgpt.com
Idea

Split your story into beats, not paragraphs:

curiosity → learning → building → experimenting

Add tiny side notes like:

“(this is where I broke my first app)”

4️⃣ Make the site feel ALIVE (micro-chaos)
Right now it’s static. Add personality through motion + detail.

Easy wins
Hover states that wiggle, not just fade

Buttons that feel clicky

Slight scroll animations (nothing dramatic)

Visual refs

https://blog-cdn.lottiefiles.com/2023/01/1_Stutpak.gif?utm_source=chatgpt.com
Even:

Cursor change on links

Tiny emoji that pops on hover 👀

5️⃣ Lean into THEMES as moods, not palettes
You already have themes — that’s cool.
But rename them emotionally.

Instead of:

Clean Slate

Dracula

Material

Try:

late night coding

calm brain

brain at 2am

soft focus

And add a one-line description when switching:

“for when my brain needs quiet.”

6️⃣ Fonts matter more than you think
Your typography is very “default dev”.

Pair something like:
Rounded sans for body

Slightly quirky font for headings

Mono only for fun bits, not everything

Visual inspo:

https://images.typ.io/1248-original?utm_source=chatgpt.com
TL;DR (but don’t skip this)
Your site is:

technically solid ✅

visually clean ✅

emotionally muted ❌

We fix it by:

shorter, more honest text

playful layouts

personality-first copy

visuals that feel human, not corporate

If you want, next we can:

rewrite your entire About section in your voice

redesign just the hero + story sections

or vibe-check your projects page

Just tell me which one we’re touching next 😌✨

You said:
repo link: https://github.com/kashik09/my-portfolio
link link: https://my-portfolio-swart-chi-59.vercel.app/
ChatGPT said:
okayyyy Kashkaiii, I opened your live site + skimmed your theme setup, and yeah: it’s clean, but it reads like “junior dev CV site” instead of “Kashi built this with vibe” 😭

Also your theme system is very “VS Code palettes” right now (super tidy + pro), which is why everything feels formal even when the layout is fine. 
globals


Now… ideas WITH visuals. Let’s go.

1) Turn the hero into a “Kashi intro”, not a résumé headline
Visual layout idea (hero)
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  hi, i’m kashi ✨                             │
│  i build cute little tools that fix          │
│  annoyances in my life (and sometimes yours) │
│                                              │
│  [ see projects ]   [ request a build ]      │
│                                              │
│  currently: full-stack + AI experiments 🧠    │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────┘
Copy options (pick one vibe)
“I build stuff because my brain refuses to accept annoying systems.”

“I turn ‘this should exist’ into real websites.”

“I code. I break it. I ship it anyway.”

2) Make “My Story” read like a person talking, not a statement of purpose
Visual format: story beats (instead of paragraphs)
[ curiosity phase ]   i used to obsess over how things work
[ learning phase ]    bootcamp + side quests + lots of resets
[ builder phase ]     i started shipping tools for real problems
[ now ]               full-stack + AI experiments + clean UI
Add tiny side notes:

“(this is where I started making everything into a project lol)”

“(still allergic to boring tools btw)”

3) Switch from “professional themes” to “mood themes” (same system, different energy)
Right now your themes are pretty formal because the palettes are “developer-default.” 
globals


Keep the theme engine, just rebrand + add personality layers.

Visual: mood theme picker
Theme:  ◉ late-night coding 🌙   ○ soft focus ☁️   ○ chaos mode ⚡
        ○ clean slate 🫧         ○ ocean brain 🌊
Rename suggestions:

Dracula → Late Night Coding

Quietlight / Clean Slate → Calm Brain

Material / Ocean Deep → Ocean Brain

Ayulight → Sunny Reset

4) Add “personality layers” (this is what stops it feeling corporate)
A) Background texture (subtle noise)
████████████████████
█░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░█  <- very subtle grain
████████████████████
B) Soft gradient glow behind the avatar
      ( avatar )
   ✨  glowing blob  ✨
C) Micro-interactions (tiny but loud)
Buttons: slight bounce on hover

Cards: tilt 1–2 degrees on hover

Links: underline becomes a doodle line

5) Your typography is doing “formal”. Fix that = instant personality.
Visual idea:

H1: playful / bold / slightly quirky
Body: clean readable
Code bits: mono for spice only
If you keep Inter, at least change the tone through spacing + weights:

bigger headings

shorter line lengths

more whitespace between sections

6) Quick theme upgrade you can do without redesigning the whole site
Since your globals.css is already theme-variable driven 
globals

, you can add one “vibe layer” globally:

Visual: section cards
┌───────────────┐
│  My Story      │   <- card has soft border + glow
│  short beats   │
└───────────────┘
Add:

softer border

slightly warmer muted text

hover glow tied to --color-primary

Pick a direction (so we don’t chaos-edit)
Choose one lane:

Soft Hacker (dark + pastel glow, playful micro-interactions)

Clean but Cute (light theme, rounded cards, sticker emojis, airy spacing)

Bold Kashi (bigger typography, punchy copy, high-contrast accents)

Tell me which one you want and I’ll give you a tight “do this, paste this” plan (hero copy + section layout + theme tweaks).

You said:
what if... i made TWO versions of the website?? like a vibey me type and a formal me type?? smthg you can switch between??
ChatGPT said:
GIRL.
That idea??? elite. galaxy brain. main character dev move. 😭⚡

Yes. 1000x yes.
And not in a gimmicky way — this actually solves a real identity problem devs have.

Let me show you how this can look + feel 👇🏾

🌓 Two Selves, One Site (this is the concept)
You’re not “confused”.
You’re multidimensional.

So the site becomes:

“Which version of me do you want today?”

Formal Kashi → recruiters, clients, institutions

Vibey Kashi → peers, creatives, curious humans

Same projects. Same brain.
Different tone, visuals, and copy.

1️⃣ The Switch (this is the magic moment)
Visual idea: identity toggle (NOT just dark/light)

https://cdn.dribbble.com/userupload/5936787/file/original-761c0f6fae9906d3f4889f5ec7da22ae.jpg?format=webp&resize=400x300&vertical=center&utm_source=chatgpt.com

Top-right switch example

Mode:
◉ vibey ✨     ○ formal 🧠
or

Viewing:
[ just vibes ] | [ professional ]
or even cheeky:

enter as:
[ human ] [ recruiter ]
When it switches:

typography changes

spacing changes

copy rewrites itself

animations turn on/off

2️⃣ SAME STRUCTURE, DIFFERENT SOUL
This is important:
You do not build two separate sites.
You build one system with two personalities.

HERO SECTION — side by side example
Vibey Mode ✨
hi, i’m kashi.
i build things because my brain won’t shut up.

sometimes they’re cute.
sometimes they actually help.
Formal Mode 🧠
Ashanti Kweyu
Junior Software Engineer | Kampala, Uganda

Focused on full-stack development and AI-enabled solutions.
Same section.
Different voice.

3️⃣ VISUAL DIFFERENCES (this is where vibes live)
Vibey Mode ✨

rounded cards

pastel glows

emojis allowed

conversational text

slightly “imperfect” layout

Formal Mode 🧠

https://repository-images.githubusercontent.com/903633865/6e115f0b-dbdf-4578-baed-1a70c7519bb8?utm_source=chatgpt.com
tighter spacing

straight edges

no emojis

muted colors

neutral tone

résumé-adjacent language

4️⃣ “My Story” becomes a personality reveal
Vibey Mode
i’ve always been obsessed with how things work.
eventually that turned into code.
now i build tools for problems i personally hate.
Formal Mode
I am an aspiring software engineer with a growing focus on
full-stack development and AI-driven applications.
This is powerful because:

recruiters get clarity

creatives get connection

you don’t have to choose

5️⃣ Projects page: SAME projects, different framing
Vibey Mode
📓 this started because my notes were a mess
→ so i built a thing
Formal Mode
Note-Taking Application
Technologies: React, Tailwind, Supabase
Focus: UX, data persistence
Same content.
Different storytelling lens.

6️⃣ This actually makes you stand out (real talk)
Most portfolios say:

“Here is my skillset.”

Yours says:

“I understand context, audience, and tone.”

That’s:

UX thinking

product thinking

communication intelligence

That’s not junior energy.
That’s designer-brain engineer energy.

7️⃣ Implementation-wise (quick reassurance)
You already have:

theme system ✅

Tailwind variables ✅

You’d just add:

data-mode="vibe" | "formal"

conditional copy

conditional font + spacing presets

No chaos. No duplicate code.

Verdict
This idea is:

smart

very you

technically clean

emotionally honest

If you want, next we can:

design the exact toggle UX

rewrite hero + story for both modes

decide what does NOT change between modes (important)

Say the word:
do we design the toggle first or rewrite the copy first? 😌✨

You said:
just give me a questionnaire so i can add this to a prompt i am working on

turn these into a sigle master prompt / logic rules but answer my questions first
ChatGPT said:
YESSS okay this is good input. You’re thinking clearly already.
I’ll do this in two clean parts like you asked:

Answer all the “give me options / you tell me” questions

Turn everything into ONE tight master prompt + logic rules you can reuse

No fluff. Let’s lock this in.

PART 1: ANSWERS + OPTIONS
1. Identity & Intent (locked in)
You’re proving:

you can do the work

you can design + build

you intentionally chose to build your own portfolio as a product

That’s strong. Keep that as a core truth.

Impact feeling options (when someone leaves):

impressed

curious

remembered

“this person actually thinks”

“this feels intentional”

“this doesn’t feel like a template”

You can pick 2–3 max.

2. Voice & Tone OPTIONS
FORMAL MODE
Three adjective sets (pick one row):

professional · clear · confident

structured · intentional · precise

calm · capable · focused

minimal · thoughtful · competent

Words / phrases to AVOID in formal mode:

“lol”

emojis

slang

lowercase-only sentences

overly personal anecdotes

“vibes”

filler like “just”, “kinda”, “random”

Professional identity sentence options:

“A software engineering student focused on building functional, well-structured web applications.”

“A junior developer with hands-on experience building full-stack and frontend projects.”

“An early-career software engineer who values clarity, structure, and intentional design.”

“A developer focused on turning requirements into reliable, usable web solutions.”

VIBEY MODE
Three adjective sets:

playful · curious · expressive

cozy · creative · honest

experimental · personal · warm

smart · casual · intentional

Words / phrases you CAN use freely:

“i”

lowercase sentences

emojis (controlled)

short lines

side comments

playful emphasis

casual honesty (“this started because…”)

Builder personality sentence options:

“I build things because my brain won’t let problems sit.”

“Most of my projects start as ‘this is annoying, I can make something better.’”

“I like turning random ideas into things that actually work.”

“I build small tools, experiment a lot, and learn by shipping.”

3. Boundaries (confirmed rules)
Must stay identical:

project list

facts

skills

experience

links

credibility

Allowed to change tone only:

descriptions

summaries

storytelling

hero copy

about section

Allowed to be completely different:

fonts

wording

layout spacing

themes

animations

interaction style

This is a GOOD boundary setup. Very sane.

4. Visual Personality (locked)
You already nailed this. No changes needed.
Just note: “organic + imperfect” does NOT mean messy. It means human-aligned.

5. Typography & Language (validated)
You’re right on all of these.
Formal = longer, structured, full sentences
Vibey = short, punchy, Gen-Z rhythm

Humor:

ONLY vibey

NEVER jokes about competence

Only personality-level humor

6. Hero Section OPTIONS
Formal Mode – one-line value statements
“Building structured, functional web applications with attention to detail.”

“Focused on building reliable, user-centered web solutions.”

“Designing and developing web applications with clarity and purpose.”

“A junior developer building practical, well-structured web products.”

Vibey Mode – philosophy options
“If a tool annoys me enough, I’ll probably try to rebuild it.”

“I learn best by making things and breaking them.”

“Curiosity → code → repeat.”

“I like building things that feel useful and a little fun.”

7. Storytelling (my recommendation)
Are struggles allowed?
YES — but framed as learning, not weakness.

Good examples:

“I’m still early in my journey, which means I experiment a lot.”

“Some projects started as class work and turned into something more.”

Curiosity & experimentation?
ABSOLUTELY yes.
That’s your strongest trait.

8. Projects Presentation (final framing)
Each project can have two lenses:

Formal Mode

what it is

tech stack

outcome

purpose

Vibey Mode

why you built it

what annoyed you

what you learned

what you’d change

Class projects = VALID.
Frame them as:

“built as part of coursework, extended independently.”

9. Interaction & Motion (approved)
Nothing to add. You’ve got good instincts here.

10. Mode Switch (answering your question)
Should the site explain the modes?
→ YES, but lightly.

Example:

first visit: tiny tooltip

“Two modes. Same work. Different vibe.”

After that: no explanation.

Persistence: YES. Always remember the choice.

11. Non-Negotiables OPTIONS
Three feelings (pick 3–4):

curiosity

warmth

confidence

intention

creativity

intelligence

authenticity

momentum

“This feels like me” sentence options:

“Intentional, curious, and quietly confident.”

“Soft but sharp.”

“Built with care, not copied.”

“Smart, personal, and still growing.”

“Not loud, but memorable.”

PART 2: MASTER PROMPT / LOGIC RULES (COPY-PASTE)
Here’s the single master prompt built from everything above 👇🏾

MASTER PROMPT
You are designing a dual-mode personal portfolio website with two distinct presentation modes: Formal Mode and Vibey Mode.

The site must prove that the creator can design and build functional websites and intentionally chose to build their own portfolio rather than use a template.

Core Rules (Non-Negotiable):

Project content, facts, skills, and experience remain identical across both modes.

Tone, wording, typography, layout, animation, and visual styling may change.

The site must never feel boring, plain, or generic.

The site must always evoke curiosity, intention, and authenticity.

Formal Mode Guidelines:

Audience: serious clients, companies, businesses.

Tone: professional, structured, clear, confident.

Visual style: minimal, structured, slightly rounded elements.

Motion: subtle only.

Emojis: none.

Copy: complete sentences, detailed explanations, outcome-focused.

Projects emphasize tech stack, outcomes, and clarity.

Vibey Mode Guidelines:

Audience: friends, family, peers, and curious visitors.

Tone: playful, cozy, expressive, honest.

Visual style: organic, slightly imperfect, rounded.

Motion: expressive and playful.

Emojis: minimal and decorative.

Copy: conversational, lowercase allowed, short punchy lines.

Humor allowed only in Vibey Mode.

Projects emphasize creativity, motivation, and learning.

Hero Section Behavior:

Formal Mode uses name/role/tagline with a clear value statement.

Vibey Mode uses a casual, expressive opening line and personal philosophy.

Storytelling Rules:

Learning journey is honest.

Struggles may be mentioned as growth.

Curiosity and experimentation are highlighted.

Mode Switching:

Mode switch is visible but subtle.

Mode selection persists across sessions.

A brief explanation is shown only on first visit.

Overall, the site should feel intentional, human, and memorable, reflecting both professional capability and authentic personality.

If you want next:

I can translate this into implementation logic (React / Next.js)

or rewrite your actual site copy using this prompt

Just say the word.

You said:
huh... i'm confused... what am i supposed to do again??
ChatGPT said:
okay pause 😭 breathe. this is ADHD-brain overload, not a real problem.
I got you. Let’s ground this.

Short answer:
You are NOT supposed to do everything right now.
You’ve already done the thinking. Now you pick one tiny next move.

What you just did (important)
You:

clarified your identity

defined two modes

answered the hard questions most people skip

That part? Done. ✅
No more abstract thinking needed.

What you are supposed to do NEXT (only this)
👉 Step 1: Save the master prompt
Copy the MASTER PROMPT I gave you.
Paste it into:

a notes doc, OR

the prompt you’re building, OR

a PORTFOLIO_VISION.md in your repo

That’s it. No editing. No perfecting.

👉 Step 2: Pick ONE concrete task (choose one)
You only choose one of these today:

Option A — Copy (easiest)

Rewrite JUST the hero section
(one for Formal, one for Vibey)

Option B — UI

Add the mode toggle (even if it does nothing yet)

Option C — Content

Rewrite the “About Me” section in Vibey voice only

Not all three. One.
If you try to do more, your brain will short-circuit.

What you are NOT doing right now
❌ redesigning the whole site
❌ perfecting themes
❌ implementing animations
❌ worrying about recruiters

That comes later.

If you want me to take over the thinking
Tell me ONE sentence:

“Let’s do [A / B / C] next.”

And I’ll:

give you exact copy OR

exact UI logic OR

exact code direction

No chaos. No overwhelm.
We move one tile at a time 🧩✨

You said:
and these??


I’ll give you vibes + concrete UI ideas, with visuals so you can see it.
1️⃣ Pick a PERSONAL aesthetic lane (not “developer default”)
Right now you’re in:
minimal • professional • safe • polite
We want:
expressive • curious • playful-smart • a little chaotic
Option A: “Soft Hacker / Creative Dev” (this feels very you)
4
How it looks
Dark or off-white background
Pastel accents (lavender, sky blue, mint)
Rounded everything
Code elements used playfully, not seriously
UI tweaks
Avatar isn’t a circle — try:
hand-drawn outline
blob shape
slightly off-center frame
Section dividers look like comments:
// about me
2️⃣ Fix the biggest offender: the HERO SECTION
Your current hero says:
“Junior Developer from Kampala, Uganda”
That’s fine… but boring 😭
Rewrite it to sound like you
Examples
“I build things because I get annoyed when tools don’t exist.”
“I turn random ideas into small, useful software.”
“I code my way out of problems I personally have.”
Visual inspiration
Layout idea
hi, i’m kashi ✨
i build small tools,
break them,
then make them better.
[ see projects ]   [ read my story ]
Short lines. Breathing space. Confidence.
3️⃣ Your text is way too formal — let it talk
Your “My Story” reads like an application essay.
Let’s humanize it.
Instead of:
“I’m an aspiring software engineer passionate about creating innovative solutions…”
Try:
“I like figuring out how things work.
At some point, curiosity turned into code.”
Or:
“Most of my projects start with ‘this is annoying, I can build something better.’”
Visual way to present this
Idea
Split your story into beats, not paragraphs:
curiosity → learning → building → experimenting
Add tiny side notes like:
“(this is where I broke my first app)”
4️⃣ Make the site feel ALIVE (micro-chaos)
Right now it’s static. Add personality through motion + detail.
Easy wins
Hover states that wiggle, not just fade
Buttons that feel clicky
Slight scroll animations (nothing dramatic)
Visual refs
Even:
Cursor change on links
Tiny emoji that pops on hover 👀
5️⃣ Lean into THEMES as moods, not palettes
You already have themes — that’s cool.
But rename them emotionally.
Instead of:
Clean Slate
Dracula
Material
Try:
late night coding
calm brain
brain at 2am
soft focus
And add a one-line description when switching:
“for when my brain needs quiet.”
6️⃣ Fonts matter more than you think
Your typography is very “default dev”.
Pair something like:
Rounded sans for body
Slightly quirky font for headings
Mono only for fun bits, not everything
Visual inspo:
TL;DR (but don’t skip this)
Your site is:
technically solid ✅
visually clean ✅
emotionally muted ❌
We fix it by:
shorter, more honest text
playful layouts
personality-first copy
visuals that feel human, not corporate
If you want, next we can:
rewrite your entire About section in your voice
redesign just the hero + story sections
or vibe-check your projects page
Just tell me which one we’re touching next 😌✨
repo link: https://github.com/kashik09/my-portfolio
link link: https://my-portfolio-swart-chi-59.vercel.app/
Thought for 55s
okayyyy Kashkaiii, I opened your live site + skimmed your theme setup, and yeah: it’s clean, but it reads like “junior dev CV site” instead of “Kashi built this with vibe” 😭
Also your theme system is very “VS Code palettes” right now (super tidy + pro), which is why everything feels formal even when the layout is fine. 
globals
Now… ideas WITH visuals. Let’s go.
1) Turn the hero into a “Kashi intro”, not a résumé headline
Visual layout idea (hero)
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  hi, i’m kashi ✨                             │
│  i build cute little tools that fix          │
│  annoyances in my life (and sometimes yours) │
│                                              │
│  [ see projects ]   [ request a build ]      │
│                                              │
│  currently: full-stack + AI experiments 🧠    │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────┘
Copy options (pick one vibe)
“I build stuff because my brain refuses to accept annoying systems.”
“I turn ‘this should exist’ into real websites.”
“I code. I break it. I ship it anyway.”
2) Make “My Story” read like a person talking, not a statement of purpose
Visual format: story beats (instead of paragraphs)
[ curiosity phase ]   i used to obsess over how things work
[ learning phase ]    bootcamp + side quests + lots of resets
[ builder phase ]     i started shipping tools for real problems
[ now ]               full-stack + AI experiments + clean UI
Add tiny side notes:
“(this is where I started making everything into a project lol)”
“(still allergic to boring tools btw)”
3) Switch from “professional themes” to “mood themes” (same system, different energy)
Right now your themes are pretty formal because the palettes are “developer-default.” 
globals
Keep the theme engine, just rebrand + add personality layers.
Visual: mood theme picker
Theme:  ◉ late-night coding 🌙   ○ soft focus ☁️   ○ chaos mode ⚡
        ○ clean slate 🫧         ○ ocean brain 🌊
Rename suggestions:
Dracula → Late Night Coding
Quietlight / Clean Slate → Calm Brain
Material / Ocean Deep → Ocean Brain
Ayulight → Sunny Reset
4) Add “personality layers” (this is what stops it feeling corporate)
A) Background texture (subtle noise)
████████████████████
█░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░█  <- very subtle grain
████████████████████
B) Soft gradient glow behind the avatar
      ( avatar )
   ✨  glowing blob  ✨
C) Micro-interactions (tiny but loud)
Buttons: slight bounce on hover
Cards: tilt 1–2 degrees on hover
Links: underline becomes a doodle line
5) Your typography is doing “formal”. Fix that = instant personality.
Visual idea:
H1: playful / bold / slightly quirky
Body: clean readable
Code bits: mono for spice only
If you keep Inter, at least change the tone through spacing + weights:
bigger headings
shorter line lengths
more whitespace between sections
6) Quick theme upgrade you can do without redesigning the whole site
Since your globals.css is already theme-variable driven 
globals
, you can add one “vibe layer” globally:
Visual: section cards
┌───────────────┐
│  My Story      │   <- card has soft border + glow
│  short beats   │
└───────────────┘
Add:
softer border
slightly warmer muted text
hover glow tied to --color-primary
Pick a direction (so we don’t chaos-edit)
Choose one lane:
Soft Hacker (dark + pastel glow, playful micro-interactions)
Clean but Cute (light theme, rounded cards, sticker emojis, airy spacing)
Bold Kashi (bigger typography, punchy copy, high-contrast accents)
Tell me which one you want and I’ll give you a tight “do this, paste this” plan (hero copy + section layout + theme tweaks).
Sources
what if... i made TWO versions of the website?? like a vibey me type and a formal me type?? smthg you can switch between??
GIRL.
That idea??? elite. galaxy brain. main character dev move. 😭⚡
Yes. 1000x yes.
And not in a gimmicky way — this actually solves a real identity problem devs have.
Let me show you how this can look + feel 👇🏾
🌓 Two Selves, One Site (this is the concept)
You’re not “confused”.
You’re multidimensional.
So the site becomes:
“Which version of me do you want today?”
Formal Kashi → recruiters, clients, institutions
Vibey Kashi → peers, creatives, curious humans
Same projects. Same brain.
Different tone, visuals, and copy.
1️⃣ The Switch (this is the magic moment)
Visual idea: identity toggle (NOT just dark/light)
4
Top-right switch example
Mode:
◉ vibey ✨     ○ formal 🧠
or
Viewing:
[ just vibes ] | [ professional ]
or even cheeky:
enter as:
[ human ] [ recruiter ]
When it switches:
typography changes
spacing changes
copy rewrites itself
animations turn on/off
2️⃣ SAME STRUCTURE, DIFFERENT SOUL
This is important:
You do not build two separate sites.
You build one system with two personalities.
HERO SECTION — side by side example
Vibey Mode ✨
hi, i’m kashi.
i build things because my brain won’t shut up.
sometimes they’re cute.
sometimes they actually help.
Formal Mode 🧠
Ashanti Kweyu
Junior Software Engineer | Kampala, Uganda
Focused on full-stack development and AI-enabled solutions.
Same section.
Different voice.
3️⃣ VISUAL DIFFERENCES (this is where vibes live)
Vibey Mode ✨
rounded cards
pastel glows
emojis allowed
playful hover effects
conversational text
slightly “imperfect” layout
Formal Mode 🧠
tighter spacing
straight edges
no emojis
muted colors
neutral tone
résumé-adjacent language
4️⃣ “My Story” becomes a personality reveal
Vibey Mode
i’ve always been obsessed with how things work.
eventually that turned into code.
now i build tools for problems i personally hate.
Formal Mode
I am an aspiring software engineer with a growing focus on
full-stack development and AI-driven applications.
This is powerful because:
recruiters get clarity
creatives get connection
you don’t have to choose
5️⃣ Projects page: SAME projects, different framing
Vibey Mode
📓 this started because my notes were a mess
→ so i built a thing
Formal Mode
Note-Taking Application
Technologies: React, Tailwind, Supabase
Focus: UX, data persistence
Same content.
Different storytelling lens.
6️⃣ This actually makes you stand out (real talk)
Most portfolios say:
“Here is my skillset.”
Yours says:
“I understand context, audience, and tone.”
That’s:
UX thinking
product thinking
communication intelligence
That’s not junior energy.
That’s designer-brain engineer energy.
7️⃣ Implementation-wise (quick reassurance)
You already have:
theme system ✅
Tailwind variables ✅
You’d just add:
data-mode="vibe" | "formal"
conditional copy
conditional font + spacing presets
No chaos. No duplicate code.
Verdict
This idea is:
smart
very you
technically clean
emotionally honest
If you want, next we can:
design the exact toggle UX
rewrite hero + story for both modes
decide what does NOT change between modes (important)
Say the word:
do we design the toggle first or rewrite the copy first? 😌✨

i had em saved, don't rememeber why tho... i just need to answer the adjectives and then get the big prompt... right???
ChatGPT said:
YES 😭 exactly. you’re right. you didn’t lose the plot — your brain just stacked too many layers at once.

Let me untangle it cleanly:

What those notes were for (the WHY)
Those long “vibes + UI ideas” notes were exploration.
They helped you:

figure out what kind of site you want

realize “oh wait… I’m two things, not one”

land on the dual-mode idea

They already did their job. ✅
You don’t need to do anything with them right now.

Think of them as:

moodboard + thinking scratchpad

Not a task list.

What you ACTUALLY need to do now
✅ Yes — you are correct:
You just need to:

Answer the adjective / options questions

Then use those answers to generate ONE big master prompt

That’s it. Nothing else.

You are not:

redesigning yet

coding yet

implementing themes yet

Ultra-clear checklist (print this mentally)
DONE already
identity & intent ✅

audiences ✅

boundaries ✅

visuals ✅

interaction rules ✅

mode-switch logic decisions ✅

STILL NEEDED (tiny)
Only these:

Formal Mode

pick 3 adjectives

pick words to avoid

pick 1 professional identity sentence

pick 1 hero value statement

Vibey Mode

pick 3 adjectives

pick words you like

pick 1 builder personality sentence

pick 1 philosophy line

Non-negotiables

pick 3 feelings

pick 1 “this feels like me” sentence

That’s all.

What happens AFTER you answer those
I will:

merge EVERYTHING into one clean master prompt

no duplicates

no vibes rambling

no UI brainstorming

just clear logic + rules

You’ll be able to:

paste it into another AI

reuse it later

build from it slowly

If it helps your brain: here’s the truth
You saved those notes because:

your intuition knew they mattered

but you hadn’t yet reduced them into rules

Now you’re at the reduction stage, not the creation stage.

That’s why it feels confusing.

Final reassurance (important)
You are not behind.
You are not messy.
You did not “forget something important.”

You’re literally one short selection step away from being done with this phase.

If you want, next message you can just send:

Formal adjectives: ___
Vibey adjectives: ___
Feelings: ___

And I’ll do the rest for you 🫶🏽

You said:
can u give me the questions again?? withe options u gave me...

✅ FINAL MASTER PROMPT (COPY–PASTE)
Title: Dual-Mode Personal Portfolio (Formal + Vibey)

You are designing a personal portfolio website with two switchable modes: Formal Mode and Vibey Mode.
Both modes present the same work, projects, skills, and facts, but differ in tone, wording, typography, layout, and interaction style.

The purpose of this portfolio is to demonstrate that the creator can design and build functional websites, and intentionally chose to build their own portfolio rather than use a pre-made template. The website itself should act as proof of capability.

Core Rules (Non-Negotiable)
Project lists, skills, experience, and factual information must remain identical across both modes.

Tone, copy, typography, spacing, themes, and animations may change.

The site must never feel boring, plain, or generic.

The site must always evoke:

warmth

confidence

intention

creativity

authenticity

The site should feel intentional, curious, and quietly confident.

FORMAL MODE
Audience: serious clients, companies, businesses.

Tone & Voice:

professional

clear

confident

minimal

thoughtful

competent

Avoid completely:

slang

emojis

lowercase-only sentences

overly personal stories

filler words (“just”, “kinda”, “random”)

jokes

casual tone

Visual Style:

minimal and structured

slightly rounded elements

muted, professional color usage

reduced motion and subtle animations only

Copy Rules:

complete sentences

detailed but concise explanations

outcome-focused language

professional first-person voice

Professional Identity Sentence (use or adapt):
“A developer focused on turning requirements into reliable, usable web solutions.”

Formal Hero Value Statement:
“Building structured, functional web applications with attention to detail.”

Projects Presentation:

emphasize tech stack

highlight outcomes and clarity

include class projects framed as legitimate development work

VIBEY MODE
Audience: friends, family, peers, and visitors who want to see the real personality behind the work.

Tone & Voice:

playful

curious

expressive

cozy

creative

honest

Allowed Freely:

first-person “i”

lowercase sentences

minimal or decorative emojis

short, punchy lines

side comments

casual honesty (“this started because…”)

expressive phrasing

light humor (never about competence)

Visual Style:

playful, cozy, and cutesy

organic, imperfect, rounded shapes

expressive animations and hover effects

personality-forward layout choices

Builder Personality Sentence:
“Most of my projects start as ‘this is annoying, I can make something better.’”

Vibey Hero Philosophy Line:
“If a tool annoys me enough, I’ll probably try to rebuild it.”

Projects Presentation:

focus on creativity, motivation, and experimentation

explain why the project exists

highlight learning, curiosity, and iteration

Storytelling Rules (Both Modes)
Learning journey should be honest.

Being early in the journey is acknowledged, not hidden.

Struggles may be mentioned, framed as growth.

Curiosity and experimentation are always highlighted.

Tone changes between modes, meaning does not.

Mode Switching Behavior
A visible but subtle mode switch allows users to toggle between Formal and Vibey.

The selected mode persists across sessions.

On first visit only, a small explanation may appear:

“Two modes. Same work. Different vibe.”

No repeated explanations after first interaction.

Overall Intent
This portfolio should feel human, intentional, and memorable.
It should communicate both professional capability and authentic personality, proving that the creator understands audience, context, tone, and design choices — not just code.

That’s it.
This is the final artifact from all that thinking.

Next steps (later, not now):

use this prompt to rewrite copy

or implement the mode toggle

or refactor themes

But for now?
You’re done. 🧠✨

You said:
i want seperate branches if possible, but i'm also wondering... how sustainable is this when it come to making changes??
ChatGPT said:
Girl: separate branches is fine for experimenting, but it’s not sustainable as the long-term way to run “two versions” of the same site.

Here’s the clean truth:

If you do two branches forever…
✅ Pros
super easy to start

you can go wild in vibey without worrying about formal

❌ Cons (this is the killer)
every feature change becomes double work

bug fixes drift (fixed in one branch, forgotten in the other)

merges become mini-wars

content updates become a mess

you’ll eventually stop updating one mode because it’s annoying

That’s how dual-branch “two sites” dies.

The sustainable way (recommended)
One main branch. One codebase. Two modes (config-driven).

You keep:

the same components

the same routes

the same data

And you switch:

copy

typography

spacing presets

animations on/off

decorative layers

This is way easier to maintain because when you change a project card component, it updates in both modes automatically.

Think of it like:
Branch approach = two separate cars you maintain

Mode approach = one car with two driving modes

Best of both worlds (what I’d do with you)
Use branches like this:
main = stable, both modes working

feat/vibey-mode = build the vibey styling + copy system

feat/formal-mode = refine formal mode copy/styling

merge both into main

But after it’s merged, you stop treating branches as “two versions” and treat them as feature work only.

Sustainability rule of thumb (simple)
If the difference is mostly:

colors

fonts

copy

animation intensity

spacing

✅ keep it one codebase with a mode toggle

If the difference is:

totally different pages

different project list/data model

different routing/site structure

Then maybe two repos or major branches makes sense, but that’s not your case.

What you should do next (tiny decision)
Pick one:

Sustainable mode toggle (recommended): one codebase, data-mode="vibey|formal" + copy map

Two branches short-term: only to prototype vibes, then merge into main

Say “1” or “2” and I’ll give you the exact branch plan + the git commands (clean, one-branch workflow, no chaos).

You said:
oh, can there be like a data center for each version and then on the main pages it just changes for js??
ChatGPT said:
YES. that’s actually the cleanest + most sustainable way to do this.
You’re thinking in the right direction now.

What you’re describing is basically:

one site, one structure, two data sources, switched by JS

And that’s exactly how you avoid maintenance hell.

The core idea (simple, no fluff)
You keep one codebase

One set of pages

One set of components

But…

👉 All copy + presentation choices live in a “data center” per mode
👉 JS decides which one to read from

So instead of hardcoding text in components, you do:

content.formal.hero.title
content.vibe.hero.title
What “data center” actually means here
Think of it as content configuration, not a database.

Example mental model
/content
  ├─ formal.ts
  ├─ vibey.ts
  └─ index.ts
Each file exports an object with:

hero text

about text

project descriptions

tone-specific labels

optional UI flags (animations on/off, emoji allowed, etc.)

JS switches between them based on mode.

How the switch works (high level)
User toggles mode (formal / vibey)

JS stores choice (localStorage or cookie)

App reads:

formalContent OR vibeyContent

Pages re-render with:

same layout

same components

different data

No reload needed if you want it smooth.

Why this is VERY sustainable
When you want to change something later…
Example: add a new project
Add project once

Give it:

a formal description

a vibey description

Done

Example: change layout
Update component once

Both modes benefit

Example: tweak tone
Edit text in ONE file

No merge conflicts

No duplicated JSX

This scales. Like actually.

What stays shared vs what changes
Shared (single source)
routing

components

layout

project IDs

logic

structure

Mode-specific (data-driven)
text

adjectives

headings

microcopy

animation intensity

emoji usage

font choices (via CSS vars)

How this compares to branches
Approach	Sustainable?	Mental load
Two long-lived branches	❌ no	high
Two repos	❌ no	very high
One codebase + mode data	✅ YES	low
Feature branches only	✅ YES	low
Branches are for building, not for identity separation.

How your repo would evolve cleanly
main
→ always stable
→ contains both modes

short-lived branches like:

feat/mode-toggle

feat/vibey-copy

feat/formal-copy

Merge → delete branch → move on.

The “aha” moment (important)
You’re not building:

“two websites”

You’re building:

one product with two lenses

That’s why this works long-term.

If you want next (pick ONE)
I can:

sketch the exact folder + file structure

show example content objects (formal vs vibey)

outline the JS logic for switching + persistence

give you git commands + branch plan

Just say the number.

You said:
before we go there... how would a / b testing work?? 
ChatGPT said:
Okay yes, A/B testing fits this idea perfectly. Here’s how it would work in a way that’s actually sustainable.

What you’d be A/B testing
You’re not testing “which personality is better” in general. You’re testing which version drives the outcome you care about.

Common portfolio outcomes:

CTA clicks (Contact / Email / WhatsApp / Book call)

Project opens (people actually viewing work)

Time on page (are they engaged)

Scroll depth (do they reach projects)

Conversion (did they message you / fill form)

So your “A” and “B” can be:

A = Formal Mode

B = Vibey Mode
(or you test just one section: hero copy A vs hero copy B, etc.)

The assignment logic (the core of A/B)
On first visit, the site randomly assigns a visitor to A or B (usually 50/50).

It persists that choice (cookie/localStorage) so they don’t flip every refresh.

Every tracked action includes the assigned variant label.

That’s the whole mechanism.

Two ways to run it (pick based on your goal)
Option 1: True A/B test (you control it, user doesn’t)
Visitors get assigned automatically.

They might not even see a toggle during the test (or the toggle exists but doesn’t change their assigned “test group”).

Best for clean data.

Use this if you want a real answer like: “Vibey leads to more contacts.”

Option 2: “Self-select” mode (not a true A/B test)
You show a toggle and people choose.

You track which mode they prefer + their behavior.

This is useful, but it’s not a pure test because people who pick “vibey” are already vibey people.

Use this if you want to learn audience preference, not prove causality.

What you track (minimum viable analytics)
You don’t need 50 events. Track these 4 and you’ll be set:

variant_assigned (A or B)

cta_click (contact button)

project_click (opened a project)

mode_toggle (if you keep the switch visible)

Optional but nice:

scroll_depth_50, scroll_depth_90

time_on_page buckets (10s, 30s, 60s)

How it blends with your “data center” idea
It’s clean:

your “content objects” are the variants

the app picks which content object to use based on the experiment assignment

everything else stays identical

That means you can A/B test:

full modes (Formal vs Vibey)

OR just one section (Hero A vs Hero B) while everything else stays the same

The biggest gotcha
If you let users freely toggle during the test, your data gets messy unless you decide:

Do you measure based on assigned variant (intention-to-treat)?

Or based on final chosen mode (post-treatment)?

Both are valid, but you must pick one, or you’ll confuse yourself later.

My recommendation for your case
Start with this:

Run a self-select “preference test” first (toggle visible)

Track:

which mode people choose

whether they click Contact

After you get traffic, run a true A/B on the hero section only (less risky)

Because full-site A/B is heavy early on.

If you tell me what your “conversion” is (WhatsApp click? email? book call?), I’ll map the exact A/B structure and what events to log.

gotchu. here’s a clean, ready-to-paste Claude prompt. no extra explanation, no fluff.

Claude Prompt: Dual-Mode Portfolio with Basic Interaction Tracking
You are helping design a dual-mode personal portfolio website with two switchable presentation modes: Formal Mode and Vibey Mode.

The site has:

one codebase

one page structure

shared components

mode-specific content pulled via JavaScript

All factual content (projects, skills, experience) is identical across modes.
Only copy, tone, typography, spacing, and interaction intensity change.

Core Requirements
Implement two content “data centers”:

formalContent

vibeyContent

Pages render dynamically based on the active mode.

Mode is stored and persisted (localStorage or cookie).

A subtle mode toggle exists (not hidden, not loud).

The website must never feel boring, generic, or template-based.

Mode Definitions
Formal Mode
Audience: serious clients, companies, businesses

Tone: professional, clear, confident, minimal, thoughtful, competent

No slang, emojis, jokes, or casual language

Structured layout, subtle animations only

Longer, outcome-focused copy

Hero value statement:
“Building structured, functional web applications with attention to detail.”

Professional identity line:
“A developer focused on turning requirements into reliable, usable web solutions.”

Vibey Mode
Audience: friends, family, peers, curious visitors

Tone: playful, curious, expressive, cozy, creative, honest

Lowercase allowed, minimal decorative emojis allowed

Short punchy lines, conversational copy

Expressive animations and hover effects

Builder personality line:
“Most of my projects start as ‘this is annoying, I can make something better.’”

Hero philosophy line:
“If a tool annoys me enough, I’ll probably try to rebuild it.”

Interaction Tracking (Basic Only)
Implement lightweight interaction tracking (no advanced analytics logic):

Track these events:

page_view

mode_selected (formal | vibey)

cta_click (contact / request / WhatsApp / email)

project_click

Each event should include:

current mode

page/section name

timestamp

Tracking can be console-logged or structured for later analytics integration.

UX Rules
Same layout and components in both modes.

Differences must feel intentional, not like two separate sites.

First visit may show a short hint:
“Two modes. Same work. Different vibe.”

After first visit, no explanation is shown.

Overall Intent
The portfolio should communicate:

technical capability

design awareness

audience sensitivity

authenticity and creativity

The site should feel warm, confident, intentional, creative, and authentic, and leave visitors feeling impacted and curious.

If you want, I can next:

adapt this prompt for code generation

or tailor it specifically for Next.js + Tailwind

You’re good now 🫶

You said:
tailor it for both... NOW
ChatGPT said:
Bet. Here are two Claude-ready prompts: one generic “generate the system” and one specifically for Next.js App Router + Tailwind. Copy-paste either (or both).

Prompt 1: Generic Code-Gen (Framework-agnostic)
You are helping implement a dual-mode personal portfolio website with one codebase and two switchable modes: Formal and Vibey.

Core Architecture
Create two mode-specific “content data centers”:

formalContent

vibeyContent

All facts must be identical across modes (projects, skills, experience). Only tone/copy/typography/spacing/motion can differ.

Pages/components must read all text and microcopy from the active content object (no hardcoded text in UI components).

Store the active mode in localStorage or cookies and persist across sessions.

Provide a subtle mode toggle that is visible but not loud.

On first visit only, show a tiny hint: “Two modes. Same work. Different vibe.”

Mode Rules
Formal Mode

Tone: professional, clear, confident, minimal, thoughtful, competent

No slang, emojis, jokes, overly personal stories, lowercase-only writing, filler words (“just”, “kinda”, “random”)

Subtle animations only

Hero value statement: “Building structured, functional web applications with attention to detail.”

Professional identity: “A developer focused on turning requirements into reliable, usable web solutions.”

Vibey Mode

Tone: playful, curious, expressive, cozy, creative, honest

Allow lowercase, short punchy lines, side comments, minimal decorative emojis, light humor (never about competence)

Expressive hover effects and motion

Builder personality: “Most of my projects start as ‘this is annoying, I can make something better.’”

Hero philosophy: “If a tool annoys me enough, I’ll probably try to rebuild it.”

Basic Interaction Tracking (Lightweight)
Implement a small tracking utility that logs structured events (console log is fine):
Track:

page_view

mode_selected (formal | vibey)

cta_click (contact / request / WhatsApp / email)

project_click

Each event should include:

mode

page/section

timestamp

Deliverables
Provide the file structure

Provide the content object schema + example content for key sections (hero, about, projects, contact)

Provide the mode state + persistence logic

Provide the toggle component

Provide the tracking utility + example usage in CTAs and project cards

Keep it clean, maintainable, and easy to extend.

Prompt 2: Next.js App Router + Tailwind (Code-Gen)
You are helping implement a dual-mode portfolio in Next.js (App Router, TypeScript) with Tailwind CSS, using one codebase and two modes: Formal and Vibey.

Requirements
Implement a mode system (not just dark/light):

Modes: "formal" and "vibey"

Persist using cookies (preferred for SSR consistency) or localStorage if simpler

Default mode can be "formal" unless a saved preference exists

All pages must render from mode-specific content objects, never hardcoded copy in components.

Content “Data Centers”
Create:

src/content/formal.ts

src/content/vibey.ts

src/content/types.ts

src/content/getContent.ts (returns correct content by mode)

Content schema must include:

hero (title, subtitle, value line, CTA labels)

about (story beats + paragraph variant)

projects (same IDs across modes, but different descriptions)

contact (CTA labels, helper microcopy)

Facts shared:

project IDs, titles, stacks, links, dates must match across modes
Only change:

descriptions, tone, labels, headings, microcopy

UI Behavior Differences (Mode-based)
Formal:

minimal + structured

subtle motion

no emojis

full sentence copy, more detailed, outcome + tech stack emphasis

Vibey:

playful/cozy/cutesy

expressive hover effects and motion

minimal decorative emojis allowed

short punchy lines, lowercase allowed, light humor

Implementation Details
Create a ModeProvider using React Context:

mode, setMode(nextMode)

On change:

update cookie/localStorage

update document.documentElement.dataset.mode = mode

optionally set a Tailwind-friendly class like class="mode-formal" or mode-vibey

Add a ModeToggle component (subtle but visible)

Add first-visit tooltip:

only once, stored as seenModeHint=true

Tailwind + Styling
Use CSS variables for theme-ish styling if needed:

--radius, --motion, --font-scale, etc.

Apply mode-specific styling via:

[data-mode="formal"] ...

[data-mode="vibey"] ...

Ensure Formal reduces motion (prefers-reduced-motion friendly).

Basic Interaction Tracking
Create src/lib/track.ts:

track(eventName, payload)

payload always includes:

mode

path (from usePathname())

section (string)

ts (Date.now())

Track these events:

page_view (in a small client component mounted in layout)

mode_selected

cta_click

project_click

Console log is fine, but structure it so analytics can be plugged in later.

Deliverables (Provide Code)
File tree + full code for:

ModeProvider.tsx

ModeToggle.tsx

content files + types

track.ts

Example usage in Hero, ProjectCard, and ContactCTA

Layout hook for page_view

Keep code production-clean, readable, and easy to extend.

Fixed Copy (Must match exactly)
Formal Hero value statement:
“Building structured, functional web applications with attention to detail.”

Formal identity line:
“A developer focused on turning requirements into reliable, usable web solutions.”

Vibey builder line:
“Most of my projects start as ‘this is annoying, I can make something better.’”

Vibey hero philosophy:
“If a tool annoys me enough, I’ll probably try to rebuild it.”

If you want, paste your repo structure (or the relevant /app + components list) and I’ll tailor the Next.js prompt even tighter to your exact file layout.
