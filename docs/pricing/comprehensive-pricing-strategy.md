## PRICING PHILOSOPHY

### The Golden Rule

**Price based on value delivered, not hours worked.**

### Why This Matters

**Scenario 1: Hourly Pricing**
- You quote 40 hours @ $50/hr = $2,000
- You become more efficient and finish in 20 hours
- You earn $1,000 (penalized for efficiency)

**Scenario 2: Value Pricing**
- Client's problem: Losing $10,000/month to manual processes
- Your solution saves them $120,000/year
- You charge $15,000 (12.5% of annual savings)
- Client happy (8x ROI), you happy ($750/hr effective rate)

### Core Principles

1. **Know Your Worth**
   - Your expertise has value
   - Your time is finite
   - Your work solves real problems

2. **Understand Client Value**
   - Revenue increase?
   - Cost savings?
   - Time saved?
   - Risk reduced?

3. **Price for Profit**
   - Not just survival
   - Reinvestment in skills
   - Business growth
   - Financial security

4. **Be Transparent**
   - Clear deliverables
   - No hidden fees
   - Honest timelines
   - Set expectations

## COST-PLUS VS VALUE-BASED PRICING

### Cost-Plus Pricing

**Formula:** (Costs + Desired Profit Margin) = Price

**Example:**
```
Project costs:
- Your time: 40 hours × $50/hr = $2,000
- Software licenses: $200
- Contractors: $500
Total cost: $2,700

Desired profit: 30%
Price: $2,700 × 1.30 = $3,510
```

**Pros:**
- Simple calculation
- Covers all costs
- Predictable profit

**Cons:**
- Leaves money on the table
- Doesn't account for expertise
- Ignores client value
- Commoditizes your work

### Value-Based Pricing

**Formula:** (Client's Gain - Client's Alternative) × Your Capture Rate = Price

**Example:**
```
Client's gain:
- New feature generates $50,000/month revenue
- Annual value: $600,000

Client's alternative:
- Hire full-time dev: $120,000/year salary + benefits
- Outsource to agency: $80,000 project cost
- Do nothing: $0 (but lose $600,000 opportunity)

Your capture rate: 10-20% of first year value
Price: $600,000 × 0.15 = $90,000

Or:
Alternative cost comparison:
$80,000 agency cost × 0.75 (you're better) = $60,000
```

**Pros:**
- Higher prices justified
- Aligns with client outcomes
- Rewards expertise and efficiency
- Creates win-win scenarios

**Cons:**
- Requires client understanding
- Harder to calculate
- Need confidence to ask
- Must demonstrate value

### When to Use Each

**Cost-Plus:**
- Commodity work (maintenance, simple fixes)
- Well-defined projects (matching existing design)
- Competitive bidding situations
- Clients focused on cost, not value

**Value-Based:**
- Strategic projects (revenue-generating features)
- Complex problem-solving (unclear solutions)
- Long-term partnerships (ongoing relationship)
- Clients focused on ROI, not cost

## CALCULATING YOUR MINIMUM RATES

### Your Break-Even Rate

**Step 1: Calculate Annual Costs**
```
Business costs:
- Software/tools: $2,400/year
- Computer/equipment: $3,000/year
- Internet/phone: $1,200/year
- Marketing: $3,000/year
- Insurance: $1,500/year
- Education: $2,000/year
Total business: $13,100/year

Personal costs:
- Living expenses: $30,000/year
- Taxes (30%): $12,900/year
- Savings (20%): $8,600/year
Total personal: $51,500/year

TOTAL ANNUAL NEED: $64,600/year
```

**Step 2: Calculate Billable Hours**
```
365 days/year
- 104 weekend days
- 10 holidays
- 15 vacation days
- 10 sick days
= 226 working days

226 days × 6 billable hours/day = 1,356 billable hours/year
(2 hours/day for admin, marketing, learning)
```

**Step 3: Calculate Break-Even Rate**
```
$64,600 ÷ 1,356 hours = $47.63/hour minimum

Round up to: $50/hour (break-even)
```

**Step 4: Add Profit Margin**
```
$50/hour × 1.5 (50% profit) = $75/hour target rate
$50/hour × 2.0 (100% profit) = $100/hour growth rate
```

### Your Target Rates

**Minimum (Never Go Below):** $50/hour
**Target (Sustain Business):** $75/hour
**Goal (Grow Business):** $100-$150/hour
**Premium (Strategic Work):** $200+/hour

## SERVICE PRICING MODELS

### Model 1: Hourly Rate

**When to Use:**
- Ongoing maintenance
- Unpredictable scope
- Client wants flexibility
- Short-term projects

**How to Price:**
```
Your hourly rate: $75-$150/hour
Minimum engagement: 5 hours
Billing increment: 15 minutes
```

**Example Packages:**
```
Maintenance Retainer:
- 10 hours/month: $750 ($75/hr)
- 20 hours/month: $1,400 ($70/hr, 7% discount)
- 40 hours/month: $2,600 ($65/hr, 13% discount)
```

**Pros:**
- Simple to calculate
- Flexible for client
- Fair for unknown scope

**Cons:**
- Income capped by hours
- Penalizes efficiency
- Harder to scale
- Client watches clock

### Model 2: Fixed Project Price

**When to Use:**
- Well-defined scope
- Repeatable projects
- Client wants certainty
- Medium-sized projects ($5k-$50k)

**How to Price:**
```
1. Estimate hours (be honest)
2. Add 20-30% buffer (unknowns)
3. Calculate value to client
4. Choose higher of:
   - Hours × rate + buffer
   - % of client value (10-30%)
```

**Example:**
```
Project: E-commerce website

Time estimate:
- Design: 16 hours
- Frontend: 40 hours
- Backend: 32 hours
- Testing: 12 hours
Total: 100 hours × $100/hr = $10,000

Buffer: $10,000 × 1.25 (25%) = $12,500

Client value:
- Expected sales: $500,000/year
- Profit margin: 30% = $150,000/year

Your capture: $150,000 × 0.15 (15%) = $22,500

Price: $22,500 (higher of two)

Or negotiate: $18,000 (still 1.8x cost-plus, $180/hr effective)
```

**Pros:**
- Predictable income
- Rewards efficiency
- Client certainty
- Can be very profitable

**Cons:**
- Scope creep risk
- Requires good estimation
- All risk on you
- Need clear contract

### Model 3: Value-Based Project

**When to Use:**
- Strategic projects
- Revenue-generating features
- Problem-solving (not just coding)
- Large clients with budgets

**How to Price:**
```
Discovery process:
1. What problem are we solving?
2. What's the cost of not solving it?
3. What's the value of solving it?
4. What alternatives exist?
5. What's success worth?

Then:
Price = (Annual value × capture rate)
Capture rate = 10-30% of first year value
```

**Example:**
```
Client: SaaS company
Problem: Onboarding drop-off (60% of signups)
Current: 1,000 signups/month, 40% convert = 400 customers
Desired: 70% convert = 700 customers
ARPU: $50/month

Monthly value: 300 new customers × $50 = $15,000/month
Annual value: $180,000/year
Lifetime value (24 months avg): $360,000

Your price: $180,000 × 0.20 = $36,000

Or tier it:
- Base fee: $20,000 (guaranteed)
- Success bonus: $1,000 per % improvement (10-70% = $60,000 max)
- Total potential: $80,000
```

**Pros:**
- Highest earning potential
- Aligns incentives
- Client sees ROI clearly
- You're a partner, not vendor

**Cons:**
- Requires sales skills
- Need client trust
- Must deliver results
- Complex pricing discussions

### Model 4: Retainer/Subscription

**When to Use:**
- Ongoing relationships
- Predictable work
- Maintenance + improvements
- Long-term clients

**How to Price:**
```
Monthly retainer = (hours/month × hourly rate) × discount

Small: 10 hours/month × $100/hr × 0.90 = $900/month
Medium: 20 hours/month × $100/hr × 0.85 = $1,700/month
Large: 40 hours/month × $100/hr × 0.80 = $3,200/month
```

**Or value-based retainer:**
```
What's the value of having me available?
- Peace of mind: $X
- Quick response time: $Y
- Priority access: $Z
- Prevented disasters: $W

Price: $2,000-$5,000/month (not based on hours)
```

**Pros:**
- Recurring revenue (MRR)
- Predictable income
- Long-term relationships
- Easier to plan

**Cons:**
- Must deliver consistent value

- Scope creep potential
- Hard to exit

### Model 5: Performance-Based

**When to Use:**
- Confident in results
- Measurable outcomes
- Client risk-averse
- High-value projects

**How to Price:**
```
Base fee (covers costs): $10,000
+ Performance bonus:
- Hit metric X: +$5,000
- Hit metric Y: +$10,000
- Hit metric Z: +$15,000

Total potential: $40,000
```

**Example:**
```
Project: SEO optimization

Base fee: $5,000 (audit + initial work)
Performance:
- 20% traffic increase: +$2,000
- 40% traffic increase: +$5,000
- 50% traffic increase: +$10,000

Total potential: $25,000+
```

**Pros:**
- Client loves it (low risk)
- You can earn multiples
- Forces accountability
- Strong partnerships

**Cons:**
- Your risk is high
- Depends on client (data access, etc.)
- Payment delays (waiting for results)
- Need ironclad metrics

## DIGITAL PRODUCT PRICING

### Factors to Consider

1. **Development Time**
   - Hours invested
   - Opportunity cost
   - Maintenance effort

2. **Market Size**
   - Niche (higher price, lower volume)
   - Mass market (lower price, higher volume)

3. **Perceived Value**
   - Time saved for buyer
   - Money saved
   - Competitive advantage

4. **Competitive Landscape**
   - Alternatives available
   - Your differentiation
   - Market rates

5. **Support Burden**
   - Documentation quality
   - Expected support needs
   - Update frequency

### Pricing Frameworks

#### Framework 1: Cost Recovery

**Goal:** Break even after X sales

```
Development cost: 80 hours × $75/hr = $6,000
Break-even sales: 40
Price: $6,000 ÷ 40 = $150

After 40 sales, all profit.
```

**Use when:** Conservative, first product, testing market

#### Framework 2: Value Multiple

**Goal:** Price at % of value delivered

```
Your product saves buyer 40 hours of work
Buyer's hourly rate: $100/hr
Value to buyer: 40 × $100 = $4,000

Your price: $4,000 × 0.10 (10%) = $400

Buyer saves $3,600 + your product ($400) vs building ($4,000)
ROI for buyer: 9x
```

**Use when:** Clear value prop, time/money savings quantifiable

#### Framework 3: Market Rate Matching

**Goal:** Price similar to competitors

```
Competitor A: $99
Competitor B: $149
Competitor C: $199

If your product is:
- Better: $199-$249 (premium)
- Same: $149 (match market)
- Simpler: $99-$129 (value option)
```

**Use when:** Established market, clear alternatives

#### Framework 4: Anchoring Strategy

**Goal:** Use high anchor to make target price seem reasonable

```
High Anchor (Enterprise): $999
Target Price (Commercial): $299 (seems like a deal)
Low Option (Personal): $99 (entry point)

Most buyers choose: Commercial ($299)
```

**Use when:** B2B products, justifiable tiers

### Tiered Pricing Strategy

**Why 3 Tiers?**
- **Decoy effect:** Middle tier looks like best value
- **Segmentation:** Different buyers, different budgets
- **Upsell path:** Personal → Commercial → Team

**Example Structure:**

```markdown
STARTER ($99)
- Personal use only
- 1 developer
- 6 months updates
- Email support
- No commercial use

PROFESSIONAL ($249) ← MOST POPULAR
- Commercial use
- 5 developers
- 12 months updates
- Priority support
- 60% choose this

TEAM ($499)
- Unlimited developers
- Lifetime updates
- Slack support
- Custom branding removal
- Setup consultation
```

**Pricing Ratios:**
- Starter: 1x (base)
- Professional: 2.5x (sweet spot)
- Team: 5x (makes Professional look good)

### Launch Pricing Strategy

**Phase 1: Early Access (First 50 customers)**
```
- 40% discount
- Lifetime updates included
- Listed as founding customer
- Input on roadmap

Starter: $99 → $59
Professional: $249 → $149

- Testimonials and case studies
- Word of mouth marketing
- Early revenue

**Phase 2: Launch Price (First 6 months)**
```
- 25% discount
- 2 years of updates
- Priority support

Starter: $99 → $74
Professional: $249 → $187
Team: $499 → $374
```

**Phase 3: Regular Price (After 6 months)**
```
- Standard pricing
- 1 year updates (Starter/Pro)
- Lifetime updates (Team)
```

**Phase 4: Mature Product (After 1 year)**
```
- Price increase (10-20%)
- Existing customers grandfathered
- New tiers introduced

Starter: $99 → $119
Professional: $249 → $299
Team: $499 → $599
Enterprise: $999 (new tier)
```

## PSYCHOLOGICAL PRICING

### Charm Pricing (Ending in 9)

```
$99 vs $100 (feels like $90s, not $100+)
$299 vs $300
$49 vs $50
```

**Use for:** B2C, lower-priced products ($1-$199)
**Avoid for:** B2B, premium products (looks cheap)

### Prestige Pricing (Round Numbers)

```
$500 vs $499 (premium, confidence)
$1,000 vs $999
$5,000 vs $4,999
```

**Use for:** B2B, consulting, high-end products
**Avoid for:** Budget-conscious markets

### Price Anchoring

**Technique:** Show high price first

```
❌ Before: $99
✅ Better: $299 $99 (save $200)

❌ Before: Choose a plan
✅ Better: Most popular: $299
         Also available: $99, $499
```

### Decoy Pricing

**Technique:** Add option that makes target option look good

```
Option A: $99 (10 features)
Option B: $149 (15 features) ← TARGET
Option C: $139 (12 features) ← DECOY

C makes B look like better value (only $10 more for 3 extra features)
Most choose B.
```

### Bundle Pricing

**Individual:**
- Product A: $99
- Product B: $79
- Product C: $59
Total: $237

**Bundle:**
- All 3: $179 (save $58, 24% off)

**Psychology:** "I'm getting a deal" + "I want it all"

---

## PACKAGING & BUNDLING

### Bundling Strategies

#### 1. Pure Bundle (Bundle Only)
```
Can only buy as a bundle, not separately.

Example:
Starter Kit: $299 (template + components + guide)

Cannot buy:
- Template alone
- Components alone
- Guide alone
```

**Pros:** Higher AOV, simpler pricing
**Cons:** May lose customers who want only one item

#### 2. Mixed Bundle (Both Options)
```
Buy separately or as bundle (discounted).

Individual:
- Template: $149
- Components: $99
- Guide: $49
Total: $297

Bundle: $199 (save $98, 33% off)
```

**Pros:** Flexibility, upsell to bundle
**Cons:** More complex, may cannibalize

#### 3. Add-On Bundle
```
Main product + optional add-ons.

Base Product: $299
Add-ons:
+ Video walkthrough: +$49
+ Priority support (1yr): +$99
+ Custom setup: +$199

Total: $299-$646
```

**Pros:** Customization, upsell opportunities
**Cons:** Decision fatigue, complex pricing

### Creating Effective Bundles

**Rules:**
1. **Complementary Products** (use together)
2. **Total Value Clear** (show savings)
3. **Logical Grouping** (makes sense)
4. **Price Discount** (20-40% off)

**Example: Developer Toolkit Bundle**

```markdown
THE COMPLETE WEB DEV TOOLKIT

Includes:
✓ Next.js SaaS Starter ($299 value)
✓ Authentication System ($129 value)
✓ Dashboard UI Kit ($179 value)
✓ Payment Integration ($99 value)
✓ Email Templates ($49 value)

Total Value: $755
Bundle Price: $399 (save $356, 47% off)

LIMITED TIME: First 100 buyers only
```

**Why it works:**
- Clear value ($755)
- Significant savings (47%)
- Scarcity (100 buyers)
- Logical (complete toolkit)

---

## DISCOUNTING STRATEGY

### When to Discount

**Good Reasons:**
- **Launch promotion** (first 50 customers)
- **Seasonal sales** (Black Friday, New Year)
- **Bundle discount** (buy more, save more)
- **Volume discount** (teams, bulk licenses)
- **Loyalty discount** (existing customers)
- **Student/Non-profit** (goodwill, future customers)

**Bad Reasons:**
- **Customer asked** (sets precedent)
- **Desperate for sale** (devalues product)
- **Competitor cheaper** (race to bottom)
- **Too expensive** (wrong pricing strategy)

### Discount Structures

#### 1. Percentage Off

```
Regular: $299
20% off: $239 (save $60)
30% off: $209 (save $90)
40% off: $179 (save $120)
```

**Use when:** Easy to calculate, larger amounts
**Avoid when:** Small amounts (20% of $10 = $2, not impressive)

#### 2. Dollar Amount Off

```
Regular: $99
Save $20: $79
Save $30: $69
Save $40: $59
```

**Use when:** Smaller prices, concrete savings
**Avoid when:** Large prices (Save $50 on $5,000 = only 1%)

#### 3. Tiered Discounts

```
Buy 1 license: $299 (full price)
Buy 3-5 licenses: $279 each (7% off)
Buy 6-10 licenses: $249 each (17% off)
Buy 11+ licenses: $219 each (27% off)
```

**Use when:** B2B, team licenses, bulk sales

#### 4. Time-Limited Discounts

```
Early Bird: 40% off (first 48 hours)
Launch Week: 30% off (next 7 days)
First Month: 20% off (next 30 days)
Regular: Full price (ongoing)
```

**Use when:** Product launches, creating urgency

### Discount Guidelines

**Maximum Discounts:**
- **Launch:** 40-50% off
- **Seasonal:** 20-30% off
- **Bundle:** 25-40% off
- **Volume:** 10-30% off (based on quantity)
- **Student:** 50% off (goodwill)
- **Regular:** 10-15% off (loyalty, referrals)

**Minimum Price:**
- Never discount below cost
- Maintain perceived value
- 50% off max (feels desperate beyond this)

**Discount Frequency:**
- **Max:** 4 major sales per year
- **Seasonal:** Black Friday, New Year, Summer
- **Product:** Launch only
- **Too often:** Trains customers to wait for sales

---

## INTERNATIONAL PRICING

### Purchasing Power Parity (PPP)

**Concept:** Same product, different prices based on local economy

**Example:**
```
Base Price (USA): $299

Adjusted Prices:
- India: $29 (10% of USA) ← Lower purchasing power
- Mexico: $119 (40% of USA)
- UK: $329 (110% of USA) ← Higher purchasing power
- Switzerland: $359 (120% of USA)
```

**How to Implement:**

Option 1: Automatic (IP-based)
```typescript
const countryPrices = {
  US: 299,
  IN: 29,
  MX: 119,
  // ...
}

const userCountry = getUserCountryFromIP()
const price = countryPrices[userCountry] || countryPrices.US
```

Option 2: Manual (User selects)
```markdown
Choose your region:
[ ] Americas: $299
[ ] Europe: $329
[ ] Asia Pacific: $29-$199
[ ] Africa: $49
```

**Pros:**
- Increased sales in low-income countries
- Price optimization per market
- More accessible

**Cons:**
- VPN abuse (people fake location)
- Perceived unfairness
- Complex implementation

**Solution:** Use Purchasing Power Parity as guideline, but implement honor system + verification.

### Currency Considerations

**Multi-Currency Pricing:**

```
USD: $299
EUR: €279 (not just conversion, rounded)
GBP: £249
INR: ₹2,499

Why not direct conversion?
- Psychological pricing (round numbers)
- Tax implications
- Payment processing fees
```

**Tools:**
- **Stripe:** Auto-converts to local currency
- **Paddle:** Handles VAT, local pricing
- **Gumroad/Lemon Squeezy:** PPP support built-in

---

## RAISING PRICES

### When to Raise Prices

**Signals:**
- High demand (selling well)
- Low refund rate (<3%)
- Positive testimonials
- Product matured (more features)
- Market research (competitors raised)
- Costs increased (hosting, tools, support)

### How Much to Raise

**Conservative:** 10-15% increase
**Moderate:** 20-30% increase
**Aggressive:** 40-50% increase (if significantly improved)

**Example:**
```
Old: $199
New: $229 (15% increase)
or
New: $249 (25% increase)
```

### How to Communicate

**Email to Existing Customers:**
```markdown
Subject: Price Update - You're Grandfathered In

Hi [Name],

Quick heads up: Starting [Date], we're increasing our prices from $199 to $249.

Good news for you: As a valued customer, you're grandfathered in at your original $199 price. Forever.

If you want to upgrade to our Team plan, you can do so at the old pricing until [Date].

Thank you for being an early supporter!

Best,
[Your Name]
```

**Website Announcement:**
```markdown
📢 Price Increase Notice

Effective [Date], our pricing will be:
- Personal: $99 → $119
- Professional: $249 → $299
- Team: $499 → $599

Existing customers: Your price won't change.
New customers: Buy before [Date] to lock in old pricing.

Why? We've added [X, Y, Z features] and hired a support team to help you faster.
```

### Grandfathering Strategy

**Option 1: Lifetime Grandfathering**
- Old customers keep old price forever
- Builds loyalty
- Encourages early adoption

**Option 2: Limited Grandfathering**
- Old price for 1-2 years
- Then gentle increase (50% of new price gap)

**Option 3: No Grandfathering**
- Everyone pays new price
- Give advance notice (90 days)
- Offer one-time "lock in old price" option

## COMMON PRICING MISTAKES

### Mistake 1: Underpricing

**Problem:**
- "I'll charge low to get customers"
- You attract price-sensitive, difficult clients
- Can't afford good support
- Burnout from overwork

**Solution:**
- Charge what you're worth
- Target ideal clients (value quality)
- Build in profit for growth

### Mistake 2: Competing on Price

**Problem:**
- Race to the bottom
- Commoditizes your work
- Unsustainable

**Solution:**
- Compete on value, not price
- Differentiate (speed, quality, expertise)
- Niche down (specialist premium)

### Mistake 3: Not Raising Prices

**Problem:**
- Costs increase (inflation, tools, skills)
- You're more experienced (worth more)
- Demand increased (you're in demand)

**Solution:**
- Review prices annually
- Raise 10-20% per year (for new clients)
- Grandfather existing clients

### Mistake 4: Scope Creep Without Extra Charge

**Problem:**
- "One more small thing..."
- Doubles project scope
- You don't charge extra

**Solution:**
- Fixed price = fixed scope
- Change orders (written, priced)
- Scope document (detailed)

### Mistake 5: Discounting Too Easily

**Problem:**
- Client: "Can you do 20% off?"
- You: "Sure!" (Instantly devalues your work)

**Solution:**
- "My prices reflect the value I deliver."
- Offer value adds, not discounts
- "I can't discount, but I can include X"

### Mistake 6: One-Size-Fits-All Pricing

**Problem:**
- Same price for all clients
- Leaves money on the table (big clients)
- Excludes potential clients (small budgets)

**Solution:**
- Tiered pricing (Starter/Pro/Team)
- Custom enterprise pricing
- Variable scope packages

### Mistake 7: Not Including Revisions

**Problem:**
- Fixed price, unlimited revisions
- Client requests endless changes
- You lose money

**Solution:**
- Include 2-3 revision rounds
- Additional revisions: +$X per round
- Define what counts as revision vs new work

### Mistake 8: Charging Hourly for Strategic Work

## PRICING CALCULATOR

### Service Project Pricing

```
INPUTS:
- Estimated hours: 50
- Hourly rate: $100
- Complexity multiplier: 1.3 (somewhat complex)
- Risk buffer: 20%

CALCULATION:
Base cost: 50 hours × $100 = $5,000
Complexity: $5,000 × 1.3 = $6,500
Risk buffer: $6,500 × 1.20 = $7,800

MINIMUM PRICE: $7,800
```

**Complexity Multipliers:**
- Simple (maintenance, bug fixes): 1.0x
- Moderate (feature additions): 1.2x
- Complex (new integrations): 1.5x
- Very Complex (architecture changes): 2.0x

**Risk Buffers:**
- Low risk (proven tech, clear scope): 10-15%
- Medium risk (some unknowns): 20-30%
- High risk (new tech, vague scope): 40-50%

### Digital Product Pricing

```
INPUTS:
- Development time: 60 hours
- Hourly rate: $75
- Target sales (year 1): 50
- Market comparables: $199-$399

CALCULATION:
Development cost: 60 × $75 = $4,500
Cost per sale: $4,500 ÷ 50 = $90

Minimum viable price: $90
Comfortable price: $90 × 2 = $180
Market-matched price: $199-$299

RECOMMENDED PRICING:
- Personal: $149 (cost × 1.65)
- Commercial: $299 (market match)
- Team: $599 (2x commercial)
```

## FINAL RECOMMENDATIONS

### For Services:

1. **Calculate your minimum rate** (break-even + profit)
2. **Never go below minimum** (no matter what)
3. **Price based on value** (not hours) when possible
4. **Create 3 packages** (Good, Better, Best)
5. **Raise prices annually** (10-20% for new clients)

### For Digital Products:

1. **Start with 3 tiers** (Personal, Commercial, Team)
2. **Use value-based pricing** (what it saves/earns)
3. **Launch discount** (40% off first 50 sales)
4. **Raise prices over time** (as you add features)
5. **Bundle strategically** (increase AOV)

### Mindset Shifts:

- **You're not expensive, you're valuable**
- **Cheap clients are expensive** (support burden)
- **Price doesn't equal worth** (but reflects positioning)
- **No doesn't mean overpriced** (might be wrong customer)
- **Charge what you need** (to sustain and grow)
