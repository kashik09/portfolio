          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-foreground">i build to understand</h2>
          <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
            most things make sense once you've tried to build them yourself. reading docs helps, but actually implementing something — breaking it, fixing it, shipping it — that's when it clicks.
          </p>
          <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
            i learn by doing. every project is either solving a real problem or teaching me something new. usually both.

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-foreground">early-career doesn't mean less capable</h2>
          <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
            i'm early in my career, but that just means i'm learning fast. i approach problems fresh, without assumptions about "how it's always been done."
          </p>
          <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
            what i lack in years i make up for in curiosity and momentum. i ship working code, not excuses.

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-foreground">iteration over perfection</h2>
          <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
            first version doesn't have to be perfect. it has to exist. then you learn what actually matters and make it better.
          </p>
          <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
            this site itself is proof of that. it's not a template. it's custom-built, iteratively improved, and reflects how i think about products.

              when something feels unnecessarily hard, that's a signal. i notice those moments and build solutions.

              not everything i build is polished. some projects are experiments. some are learning exercises. i keep them visible because the journey matters.

              i think end-to-end. design, code, deployment, iteration. i want to understand the whole product lifecycle, not just one piece of it.
